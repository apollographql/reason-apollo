# Reason-Apollo Swapi

This project illustrates the usage of reason-apollo to query the [SWAPI](http://swapi.apis.guru/) and serves as an example on how to use the project.

## Getting started

```
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run webpack
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.

To go directly to `index.html` open `http://localhost:8080/src/` in your browser.
